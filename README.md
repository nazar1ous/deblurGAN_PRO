Team: Nazarii Kuspys, Dmytro Lutchyn

The project supports hydra config.
To begin with, one should install requirements.txt. However, you can reinstall pytorch if your working setup differs from (Linux, pip).

To start training the model, you should specify parameters in the config/config.yaml.
Also, look through all configurations for the specified parameters (dataset config for example).
